# Hello World 🐍

I made a example project just to test the basic git and gitHub workflow.

# Description

This repository has a script that prints **Hello World** using python as my language.  
The goal of my project was to practice:

- Initializing a git repository
- Making commits
- Pushing code to gitHub
